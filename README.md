## About
 This project is a web scraping lab designed to automate the process of identifying "citation needed" statements within Wikipedia articles. The core functionality involves parsing Wikipedia pages selected by the user to find and report sections that require additional citations for verification. This not only aids in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of Wikipedia content but also serves as a practical exercise in web scraping and data processing.

## Resources
I used the help of some TA's as well as ChatGPT for this assignment.
